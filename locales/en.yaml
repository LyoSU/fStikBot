    problems: |
      <b>❓ FAQ & Fixes</b>

      <b>⚫ Background turned black?</b>
      Telegram removes transparency when you send as "Photo".
      → Send PNG as <b>File</b> (📎 paperclip icon).

      <b>🔄 Changes not showing?</b>
      Telegram caches stickers. Wait ~1 hour or restart the app.

      <b>📹 Video not animating?</b>
      Likely a weird format. Try converting to MP4 or send as File instead of Video.

      <b>🗑 How to delete a sticker?</b>
      Send /delete, then tap the sticker you want to remove.

      <b>🤏 Sticker too small?</b>
      Crop your image to a square (1:1) before sending.

      <b>🔗 How to remove "_by_fStikBot" from link?</b>
      You can't. Telegram requires this suffix to identify which bot created the pack. It's a platform rule, not ours.

      <b>💎 Do I need Premium?</b>
      • Create packs: Free
      • Use stickers: Free
      • Send custom emoji: Premium only (Telegram rule)
