      <b>🗃 Sticker pack restoration</b>

      If you previously created a sticker pack through this bot and cannot find it in the list of your sticker packs, then you can restore it back.

      <b>To do this, you need to perform several actions:</b>
      1. Open @Stickers bot
      2. Send <code>/packstats</code> command
      3. Find and choose the required sticker pack
      4. Forward the received message to the bot
      5. If restoration is successful - bot informs about it
