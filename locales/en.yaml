    <b>🗃 Sticker pack restoration</b>

    If you previously created a sticker pack through this bot and cannot find it in the list of your sticker packs, then you can restore it back.

    <b>To do this, you need to perform several actions:</b>
    1. Open @Stickers bot
    2. Send <code>/packstats</code> command
    3. Find and choose the required sticker pack
    4. Forward the received message to the bot
    5. If restoration is successful - bot informs about it

    <b>🗄 Copy sticker pack</b>

    If you supported the bot, copying all the stickers from any sticker pack with a new name will be available.
    In order to copy the sticker pack you just need to send a link to it to the bot.
